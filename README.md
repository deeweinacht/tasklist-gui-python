This application is a basic task list. 
It allows the user to add, edit, and complete(remove) tasks from a task list. 
The program comes with three separate interfaces: a console interface, a gui interface, and a web interface.

Using the app:
The simplest way to use the app is via the GUI interface. Simply run the graphical_interface.exe in the dist folder.
To access the console interface run the console_interface.py file in a Python 3.10 IDE.
The web application is currently not hosted online, but may be accessed by entering the command 'streamlit run web_interace.py'
in a terminal to access a locally hosted version.
